Welcome to the Remote Presentation Software written for Node.js

I used it for an English Project, on the book "Hard Times" from Charles Dickens. I wrote it in a single class period, after noticing that many other students needed a partner to click through the powerpoint slides (causing issues with the presentation).

This software allowed me to use my iPad to remotely control the presentation, tapping buttons, and also inject new information into the presentation on the fly as I saw fit.



## Running the server

1) Open `server.js` and start the app by clicking on the "Run" button in the top menu.

2) Alternatively you can launch the app from the Terminal:

    $ node server.js

Once the server is running, open the project in the shape of 'https://projectname-c9-username.c9.io/'. As you enter your name, watch the Users list (on the left) update. Once you press Enter or Send, the message is shared with all connected clients.
